    The weekend-long event features a full bill of talent from New York’s own thriving folk music scene, as well as national and international blues, country and jazz artists. We invite the community to come listen, play and celebrate. We’ll have over 20 bands, instrument lessons and workshops, jam sessions, great food, and much more.
